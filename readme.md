## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin to support [Textr][].

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees
(ASTs).
**remark** adds support for markdown to unified.
**mdast** is the markdown AST that remark uses.
This is a remark plugin that transforms mdast with Textr.

## When should I use this?

This project is useful if you want to automatically improve the text in your
markdown documents.
[Textr][] is a simple way to do that: no need to worry about ASTs.
On the other hand, ASTs are powerful, so some things are better done with
custom plugins: see [Create a plugin][create-a-plugin].

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-textr
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import remarkTextr from 'https://esm.sh/remark-textr@5'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkTextr from 'https://esm.sh/remark-textr@5?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

````markdown
## spread operator...

```js
function(...args) { return args; }
```
````

And our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkTextr from 'remark-textr'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkTextr, {plugins: [ellipses]})
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.log(String(file))
}

/**
 * Textr plugin: a function that replaces triple dots with ellipses.
 *
 * @type {import('remark-textr').TextrPlugin}
 */
function ellipses(input) {
  return input.replace(/\.{3}/gim, '…')
}
```

Yields:

````markdown
## spread operator…

```js
function(...args) { return args; }
```
````

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkTextr`.

### `unified().use(remarkTextr[, options])`

Plugin to [improve typography][typewriter-habits] with [**Textr**][textr].

##### `options`

Configuration.

###### `options.plugins`

List of [Textr][] plugins (`Array<Function | string>?`).
If strings are passed in, those are loaded with `import`.
Textr plugins are available on npm labelled with a [`textr`][textr-plugins]
keyword.
You can also create them yourself, as shown in the example above.

###### `options.options`

[Textr][] options (`Object?`).
For example, you may want to set the [ISO 639-1][iso] [locale code][locale] of
the content, which is important for stuff like the correct primary and secondary
quotes.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports `Options` and `TextrPlugin` types, which specify the interface of the
accepted options and Textr plugins.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This plugin works with `unified` version 6+ and `remark` version 7+.

## Security

Use of `remark-textr` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype] ([**hast**][hast])
or user content so there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attacks.
[Textr][] operates on text nodes, which are always escaped by remark.
